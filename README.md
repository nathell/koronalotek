# koronalotek

## What is this about?

[Guess tomorrow’s number of COVID-19 cases in Poland](http://blog.danieljanus.pl/2020/11/08/coronalotto/).

## Running it

Run `clj` in the main directory. Then do:

```clojure
(require 'koronalotek.core)
```

You should see the app running on https://localhost:8008. After a few seconds, the number should be automatically updated to reflect today’s stats.
